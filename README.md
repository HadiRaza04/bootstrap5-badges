Make different badges using Bootstrap5 properties from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools</a>.

1) Badges are used to add additional information to any content. Use the <b>.badge</b> class together with a contextual class (like <b>.bg-secondary</b>) within <b>span></b> elements to create rectangular badges. Note that badges scale to match the size of the parent element (if any).

2) Use any of the contextual classes <b>(.bg-*)</b> to change the color of a badge.

3) Use the <b>.rounded-pill</b> class to make the badges more round.
